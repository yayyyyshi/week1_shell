# 🌍 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different industrial sectors and commodities using machine learning. The aim is to provide insights and forecasting tools for policymakers and environmental researchers working towards sustainable development.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Build a supervised ML model to predict GHG emissions.
- Perform extensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
- Compare multiple models and evaluate performance using advanced metrics.
- Deploy the model using Streamlit for public interaction.
- Present results in a meaningful way for climate-related policy use.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with real-world environmental datasets.
- Model building, evaluation, and deployment pipeline.
- Streamlit web app development.
- Git & GitHub version control best practices.
- Policy-centered application of ML models.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Retrieved from Kaggle.
2. **Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features.
3. **EDA** – Visual exploration (heatmaps, pairplots, boxplots).
4. **Modeling** – Tried Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. **Evaluation** – Compared models using accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall.
6. **Deployment** – Built an interactive web app using Streamlit.

## 🔧 Improvisations Done by Me

- Tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV for optimized accuracy.
- Created a clean, modular, and documented codebase.
- Enhanced Streamlit UI for better interpretability (tooltips, visuals).
- Applied contextual imputation based on industry/commodity patterns.
- Framed the app to support policy simulations and future expansion.
- Integrated advanced feature importance analysis.
- Structured GitHub repo with clear foldering and README.
